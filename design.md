# Design Document: Local Code-Aware Intelligent Training Data Generation and Processing

## 1. Overview
This document describes a system for automating the generation and processing of intelligent training data from local codebases. The system supports two main scenarios:
- Extraction of Q&A pairs from code context and business logic.
- Generation of trace data based on code architecture.

## 2. Q&A Pair Extraction
### 2.1. Scenario
Automatically generate Q&A pairs from local code to support intelligent training workflows. Each Q&A pair should reflect a business-relevant question and its answer, derived from code structure, comments, and docstrings.

### 2.2. Approach
- Parse source code files (e.g., Python).
- Extract function/class docstrings and comments.
- Generate questions such as:
  - "What does function X do?"
  - "What are the inputs/outputs of class Y?"
- Use extracted documentation as answers.
- Optionally, use code context (e.g., function calls, variable names) to enrich Q&A pairs.

### 2.3. Example
**Q:** What does the `process_data` function do?
**A:** It processes input data and returns the cleaned result. (from docstring)

## 3. Trace Data Generation
### 3.1. Scenario
Generate trace data to reflect the execution flow or architecture of the codebase, supporting downstream analysis and model training.

### 3.2. Approach
- Parse code to build a call graph (which functions call which).
- Optionally, instrument code to log execution traces (using decorators or logging).
- Output trace data in a structured format (e.g., JSON, CSV).

### 3.3. Example
```json
{
  "function": "main",
  "calls": ["load_data", "process_data", "save_results"]
}
```

## 4. Implementation Plan
- Use Python for code parsing and data generation.
- Support any public GitHub repo (default: Python code).
- Scripts:
  - `generate_qa.py`: Extracts Q&A pairs.
  - `generate_trace.py`: Generates trace data.
- (Optional) `validate_data.py`: Simple script/model to verify data effectiveness.

## 5. (Optional) Model/Data Validation
- Use a simple script to check if generated Q&A pairs and trace data are meaningful.
- Optionally, train a small model to validate data utility.

## 6. Traceability
- All generated data should be traceable to code locations (file, line number).

## 7. Extensibility
- The system can be extended to support more languages and advanced analysis.
